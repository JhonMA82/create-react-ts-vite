- `.github/.release-please-manifest.json`: Version tracking
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`: Release PR creation workflow
- `.github/workflows/publish-npm.yml`: npm publishing workflow
- `.husky/commit-msg`: Commit message validation
- `.husky/pre-commit`: Pre-commit checks
- `commitlint.config.js`: Commit message validation rules

## Requirements

- GitHub repository with appropriate permissions
- NPM_TOKEN secret configured in GitHub Actions
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- pnpm package manager

## Examples

```bash
# Check release status
/release status --verbose

# Smart commit - automatic analysis
/release commit

# Manual commits
/release commit feat "Add user profile page"
/release commit fix "Resolve login issue on mobile"

# Smart release - automatic version suggestion
/release release

# Manual releases
/release release --minor
/release release --patch --prerelease

# Verify configuration
/release verify

# Show unreleased commits analysis
/release release
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Commit message validation fails**: Ensure your commit message follows conventional commits format
2. **Release PR not created**: Check GitHub Actions permissions and repository settings
3. **npm publishing fails**: Verify NPM_TOKEN is correctly configured in GitHub secrets
4. **Pre-commit hooks fail**: Run checks manually to identify issues

## Workflow

1. Make commits using conventional commits format
2. Push to main branch
3. Release-please creates a Release PR
4. Merge the Release PR
5. GitHub Actions publishes to npm automatically
